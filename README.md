# chip8-emu
A CHIP-8 emulator developed for educational purposes

## Roadmap
 - [x] A "debug" version that only displays the current cpu context, without no graphics and no sound
    - With this version, I hope to run a simple "Sum of first n natural numbers" program
    - This version will only implement single-stepping
